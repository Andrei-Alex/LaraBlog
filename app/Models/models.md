# Models Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all the Eloquent models of the Laravel 10 project. Eloquent models are the primary method for interacting with your database. Each model typically corresponds to a single table in your database and provides a convenient and expressive way to query for data, as well as insert, update, and delete records from that table.

## Structure

- Each file in this folder represents a single model.
- Model names are singular and capitalized, following the Laravel naming convention.
- Relationships, scopes, and other model-specific methods are defined within these models.

## Key Features

- **Eloquent ORM**: Provides an active record implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding model through which you interact with that table.
- **Relationships**: Define relationships (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) between your models.
- **Mass Assignment Protection**: Automatically protects against mass-assignment vulnerabilities.
- **Scopes**: Allows for reusing query logic in models.
- **Mutators and Accessors**: Customize how you retrieve and set values on your model attributes.

## Best Practices

- Keep the Eloquent queries and database logic within these models.
- Follow the [PSR standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) for coding style.
- Document any complex logic within your models for easier maintenance and readability.

## Note

Remember to adhere to the principles of MVC architecture. Keep your database interactions within the models to maintain clean and maintainable code structure in your Laravel project.
