# HTTP Requests Folder

This folder contains a collection of files related to HTTP requests in our application. Each file represents a different aspect of handling, creating, and managing HTTP requests. This includes:

- **Controllers**: Classes that handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
- **Requests**: Custom request classes that encapsulate validation rules and authorization logic for specific types of requests.
- **Middlewares**: Filters that process incoming requests before they hit the controller, and outgoing responses before they are returned to the client.
- **Routes**: Files that define the URL structure of our application and map URLs to corresponding controller actions.

The structure and content of this folder are key to understanding how our application processes and responds to various HTTP requests, ensuring efficient and secure web communication.
