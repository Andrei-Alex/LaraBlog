# Controllers

This directory contains the Controller classes of the Laravel application. Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses to the client.

## Overview

Controllers in Laravel are stored in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory. Each controller within this directory typically corresponds to a specific area of functionality within the application.

## Responsibilities

- **Routing**: Controllers receive requests based on the routes defined in `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`.
- **Logic**: They contain the main logic to process the request, interact with models, and prepare the response.
- **Views**: In case of web routes, controllers often return views with data to be rendered in the user interface.
- **API Responses**: For API routes, controllers usually return JSON responses.
- **Request Handling**: Controllers handle and validate incoming requests and form submissions.

## Best Practices

- Controllers should be kept "thin", meaning most of the business logic should reside in models or service classes.
- Use dependency injection to provide controllers with the resources they need, such as models or services.
- Organize controllers logically, typically mirroring the structure of the application's features or resources.

## Structure

Controllers in this directory may follow a naming convention that reflects their purpose, such as `UserController`, `OrderController`, etc. They can be organized further into subdirectories for better modularity.
